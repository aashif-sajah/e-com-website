      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Life below water encompasses the vast marine ecosystems that cover more
        than 70% of our planet's surface. United Nations Sustainable Development
        Goal 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and
        marine resources for sustainable development.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p class="ocean-sea">
          Oceans and seas are essential for life on Earth. They regulate the
          climate, produce oxygen, and provide food and livelihoods for millions
          of people. However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution,
          and climate change are threatening these vital ecosystems.

      <div class="actionTaken">
        <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
        <p>
          Governments, NGOs, and communities worldwide are taking various
          actions to address the challenges facing our oceans:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):</strong> Establishing
            protected areas helps conserve marine biodiversity and habitats,
            allowing ecosystems to recover and thrive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sustainable Fishing Practices:</strong> Implementing
            regulations to prevent overfishing, such as setting catch limits and
            enforcing size restrictions, ensures the long-term viability of fish
            stocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reducing Plastic Pollution:</strong> Initiatives to reduce
            single-use plastics and promote recycling help mitigate the impact
            of plastic pollution on marine life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Climate Action:</strong> Addressing climate change is
            crucial for protecting marine ecosystems. Efforts to reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources
            are essential.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>
      <p>
        Achieving Goal 14 requires international cooperation and concerted
        efforts to protect marine biodiversity, reduce pollution, regulate
        fishing practices, and promote sustainable ocean-based economies.
        Individuals, governments, businesses, and organizations all have a role
        to play in safeguarding life below water for present and future
        generations.
